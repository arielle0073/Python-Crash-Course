#   9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
#   Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
#   instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers
#   the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

#   Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of
#   customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
#   print the value again.

#   Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the
#   number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number you
#   like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of
#   business.
