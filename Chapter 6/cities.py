#   6-11. Cities: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities
#   as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each
#   city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate
#   population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s
#   dictionary should be something like country, population, and fact. Print the
#   name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it.
