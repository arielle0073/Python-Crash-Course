#   6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
#   different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the
#   ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop
#   through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.
