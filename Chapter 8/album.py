#   8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
#   describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
#   album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces
#   of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing
#   different albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are
#   storing the album information correctly. Use None to add an optional
#   parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of songs on an
#   album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of songs, add
#   that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function call
#   that includes the number of songs on an album.
